         * this concept lets break n into (n/x) xâ€™s then their product will be x(n/x),
         * now if we take derivative of this product and make that equal to 0 for
         * maxima, we will get to know that value of x should be e (base of the natural
         * logarithm) for maximum product. As we know that 2 < e < 3, so we should break
         * every Integer into 2 or 3 only for maximum product.
